# [Grandma's New School Recipe Box](https://benjaminadk.github.io/recipebox/)

 - React and Foundation
 - A Freecodecamp Project
 - Uses localStorage to save recipes
 - Each recipe is an object with name, ingredients, instructions and a url for a thumbnail photo
 - Instructions are multidimensional, meaning the user inputs "item,quantity,item,quantity" and the app sorts and displays
    everything accordingly
 
 
 ### Notes To Self
 
 - used Favicon Generator to mass produce favicons for almost everything from one source file
